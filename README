gst-droidmediabuffer_to_glmemory
================================

The droidmediabuffertoglmemory element convert DroidMediaBuffer into GLMemory
consumable by various system in GStreamer by creating an EGLImage and target
it to a texture.

DroidMediaBuffer is a memory type from gst-droid that wraps Android's native
GPU buffer. This is being used for hardware-accelarated video decoding (by
droidvdec element) and camera preview (by droidcamsrc element).

Originally, DroidMediaBuffer is designed to be used by gst-droid's
droideglsink only. The sink works by creating an EGLImage for each buffer,
provide it to an application, and the application is requied to target the
image to its texture.

However, there's nothing that prevents doing all of that in a single
GStreamer element, and then pass the texture on to another part of GStreamer
inside a standard (wrapped) GLMemory. This is essentially what this element
does, enabling the use of various Gstreamer's OpenGL facility without special
knowledge of how DroidMediaBuffer works. Neat, huh?


About the branches
------------------

The master branch contains the currently working version of the plugin. However,
before reaching this, I've tried 2 methods that doesn't work. For anyone
interested, I've uploaded them into branch method1(-sync) and method2.
